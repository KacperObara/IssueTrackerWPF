# IssueTracker
 
The goal of this project is to create working application using 2 of the most important c# project types.
The first is Class library. When this is done, I plan to create similar application using WebAPI. 
I believe, that showing both of them performing the same task will help people to understand them better.

Technologies used:
[Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) - Powerful MVVM framework.
[FluenValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) - Tool for clean and easy data validation.
