# IssueTracker

Finished issue tracker that keeps track of reported bugs in projects. Supports multiple users.

Technologies used:  
[Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) - Powerful MVVM framework.  
[FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) - Tool for clean and easy data validation.  
[Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) - Object-relational mapper for .Net 

Currently, I'm creating similar application using ASP.Net with Web API, MVC and Entity Framework.
