# IssueTracker
 
The goal of this project is to create a working application using 2 of the most important c# project types.
The first is Class library. When this is done, I plan to create similar application using WebAPI. 
I believe, that showing both of them performing the same task will help people to understand them better.

Technologies used:  
[Caliburn.Micro](https://caliburnmicro.com/) - Powerful MVVM framework.  
[FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) - Tool for clean and easy data validation.  
[Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) - Object-relational mapper for .Net 

In the future, I plan to create a similar application using ASP.Net with Web API, MVC and Entity Framework.
